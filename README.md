# 🌐 Kisan Samvad – Empowering Farmers with AI Support 🌾🤖
## Hey Connections!
I'm excited to share my recent Full Stack College Project – Kisan Samvad, an AI-powered platform designed to assist farmers by generating helpful responses based on their queries in real time. 🧑‍🌾💬

This application was built using the MERN stack along with Google Generative AI (Gemini API) and aims to:

🤝 Enable real-time farmer-AI interaction in Hindi.

📑 Allow farmers to ask agriculture-related questions and get meaningful AI-generated responses.

🧠 Simplify technical knowledge into easy-to-understand suggestions for the rural community.
